## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vivid magenta (#F04080), chosen for its energetic and modern feel. This will bring a dynamic, upbeat tone to the application, suggesting lively experiences and community engagement.
- Background color: Light pink (#F8D8E8). This maintains a consistent magenta hue while softening the overall look and providing a gentle backdrop that doesn't compete with the primary color.
- Accent color: Deep violet (#8040F0) offers a bold contrast to the pink tones, ensuring important interactive elements stand out distinctly.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif known for its clean, modern, and highly readable design, makes it a great choice for both headlines and body text, making the app approachable.
- Simple, clear icons that reflect event categories and actions, enhancing usability. The icons will have the same violet of the accent color.
- Clean and organized layout that prioritizes ease of navigation. Implement clear visual hierarchy to guide users to key information and actions. Use white space effectively to avoid clutter and enhance readability.
- Subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience, such as fading effects when loading events, or animated category icons. Animations should be smooth and purposeful, avoiding distracting or unnecessary effects.
